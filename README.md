Access the app on:- https://imagebook.netlify.app/

It is a social media web app, where you can send your video message to another person, in the form of either Respect, good luck, feedback, or promise etc.
Since videos is a better way of expressing thoughts, hence you can share your thoughts with your loved ones.

This app is based on contact and numbers, so that you can connect to your knowns easily.

If the user whom you are sending, hasn't signed up yet, You can still send a message to their temporary profile, so as soon as they sign up, they will be able to access their messages.

Also, since it has an integrated video recorder, it creates a video, which is lesser in space, as compared to the videos uploaded from files.

Get onboard to experience a new idea of connection.
